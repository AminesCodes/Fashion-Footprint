# Fashion-Sustainability

# Problem: 
Around 30 percent of all clothes made around the world are never sold, according to the Australian Circular Textile Association (ACTA) and the cost of this inventory distortion is estimated by IHL Group in 210 billion US dollars.

# Solution: 
An app that allows brands to share their designs and styles pre-season so that consumers can vote on the styles they're most likely to buy in order to prevent over-production of garments, therefore eliminating waste. App will also be used to educate consumers on how to care for their garments in an attempt to extend their lifecycle, as well as educating consumers on the environmental effects of different textiles.
